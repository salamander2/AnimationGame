# AnimationGame -- Stage 4 code
Programming a side scrolling animation game for ICS3U/4C

:boom: Requires HSA2 graphics library :boom: 

----
## Stage 1 : make a player and move it

Make a player object (can just be a rectangle) and move it around on the screen using keys.


This is now done! See the code above.

## Stage 2 : make an enemy and move it

Done. 

## Stage 3 : handle collisions with enemy

Done. 

## Stage 4 : change single enemy into arraylist of enemies

Done. 

## Stage 5 : make winning conditions

Done. There are various ways of doing this. I've just added this to stage 4 instead of making a new stage for such a small thing.
