Programming a side scrolling animation game for ICS3U/4C

:boom: Requires HSA2 graphics library :boom: 

----
## Stage 1 : make a player and move it

Make a player object (can just be a rectangle) and move it around on the screen using keys.

:white_check_mark: This is now done! See the code above.

## Stage 2 : make an enemy and move it

:white_check_mark: See the code here in the [stage2 branch](https://github.com/salamander2/AnimationGame/tree/Stage2). 

## Stage 3 : collide with enemy

:white_check_mark: This is now done!
See the code here in the [stage3 branch](https://github.com/salamander2/AnimationGame/tree/Stage3). 

## Stage 4 : change single enemy into arraylist of enemies
## Stage 5 : make winning conditions

:white_check_mark: Done. 
:white_check_mark: Stage 5: There are various ways of doing this. I've just added this to stage 4 instead of making a new stage for such a small thing.

See the code here in the [stage4 branch](https://github.com/salamander2/AnimationGame/tree/Stage4). 

## Stage 6 : add lasers/bullets. Win if all of the enemies have been shot.

:white_check_mark: This is now done!
See the code here in the [stage6 branch](https://github.com/salamander2/AnimationGame/tree/Stage6). 

_I'm putting it in separate branches so that students who are behind and want to learn :bulb: can still work through it stage by stage, 
trying their own code before looking at my answers._
