# AnimationGame -- Stage 2 code
Programming a side scrolling animation game for ICS3U/4C

:boom: Requires HSA2 graphics library :boom: 

----
## Stage 1 : make a player and move it

Make a player object (can just be a rectangle) and move it around on the screen using keys.


This is now done! See the code above.

## Stage 2 : make an enemy and move it

<<<<<<< HEAD
Done. See code here.

To see any future stages, go back to main branch and then follow links to the branch called Stage3
=======
This is now done!
See the code here in the [stage2 branch](https://github.com/salamander2/AnimationGame/tree/Stage2). 

I'm putting it in separate branches so that students who are behind and want to learn :bulb: can still work through it stage by stage, 
trying their own code before looking at my answers.
