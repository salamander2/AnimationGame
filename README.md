# AnimationGame -- Stage 6 code
Programming a side scrolling animation game for ICS3U/4C

:boom: Requires HSA2 graphics library :boom: 

----
## Stage 1 : make a player and move it

Make a player object (can just be a rectangle) and move it around on the screen using keys.


:white_check_mark: Done

## Stage 2 : make an enemy and move it

:white_check_mark:Done. 

## Stage 3 : handle collisions with enemy

:white_check_mark:Done. 

## Stage 4 : change single enemy into arraylist of enemies

:white_check_mark:Done.  `MainGame.java` is the only file that's been changed.

## Stage 5 : make winning conditions

:white_check_mark:Done and combined with stage 4 (there's no point making a whole stage just for something so small). 
_There are various ways of making winning conditions. Yours might be different, that's okay._

## Stage 6 : add lasers / bullets. Shoot enemies, win if there are none left.

:white_check_mark: Done.
